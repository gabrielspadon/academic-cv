abstract: Complex networks provide a means to describe cities through their street
  mesh, expressing characteristics that refer to the structure and organization of
  an urban zone. Although other studies have used complex networks to model street
  meshes, we observed a lack of methods to characterize the relationship between cities
  by using their topological features. Accordingly, this paper aims to describe interactions
  between cities by using vectors of topological features extracted from their street
  meshes represented as complex networks. The methodology of this study is based on
  the use of digital maps. Over the computational representation of such maps, we
  extract global complex-network features that embody the characteristics of the cities.
  These vectors allow for the use of multidimensional projection and clustering techniques,
  enabling a similarity-based comparison of the street meshes. We experiment with
  645 cities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo. Our results show how the joint
  of global features describes urban indicators that are deep-rooted in the network's
  topology and how they reveal characteristics and similarities among sets of cities
  that are separated from each other.
