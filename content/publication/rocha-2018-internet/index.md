abstract: This paper aims at introducing a methodology focused on student-centered
  learning and aided by an educational collaborative and graphical tool. Through it,
  we enable students to interact with abstract topics as well as interact with each
  other. Our motivation was the lack of capability to represent knowledge and abstractions
  faced by students that work alone. In this regard, we present as result a tool to
  be used in the whole educational processes, together with a teaching-learning methodology
  that is described from multiple points of view.
