 abstract = {Seaports play a crucial role in the global economy, and researchers have sought to understand their significance through various studies. In this paper, we aim to explore the common characteristics shared by important ports by analyzing the network of connections formed by vessel movement among them. To accomplish this task, we adopt a bottom-up network construction approach that combines three years' worth of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from around the world, constructing a Ports Network that represents the connections between different ports. Through such representation, we use machine learning to measure the relative significance of different port features. Our model examined such features and revealed that geographical characteristics and the depth of the port are indicators of a port's significance to the Ports Network. Accordingly, this study employs a data-driven approach and utilizes machine learning to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to ports' importance. The outcomes of our work are aimed to inform decision-making processes related to port development, resource allocation, and infrastructure planning in the industry.},
