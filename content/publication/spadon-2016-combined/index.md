abstract: Theoretical Computer Science area (TCS) stands out by being an important
  study field, and it is composed by Formal Languages and Automata Theory (FLA), Computer
  Science Theory (CST), and Theory of Compilers (TC). This area is responsible for
  introducing the beginnings of the Computer Science through formalisms - which represent
  a set of methods, techniques, or rules that describe the solution to a problem with
  restrictions - and it has a substantial impact on the student's knowledge. Computer
  science theory is based on the understanding of computability and techniques to
  solve challenges, and to improve the teaching-learning process used to introduce
  these concepts we proposed a Combined Methodology for Theoretical Computing (CMTC).
  Our methodology is based on formalism development to ground the knowledge acquired
  during classes of FLA, CST, and TC, where students are introduced to Theoretical
  Computing during one year and a half. In each course, we applied the same methodology
  where each student used data structures, computer graphics, and algorithms to solve
  problems. We address this methodology to understand how much the incomprehension
  of formalisms is influenced by new concepts and its abstractions. Against this background,
  we demonstrate that the that CMTC has the aim to build knowledge and make the new
  concepts and formalisms concrete. Our results are based on statistical analysis
  from students' grades, where we could observe among other results, the correlation
  between the practical activities and the conceptual knowledge.
