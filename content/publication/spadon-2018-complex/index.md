abstract: "Complex networks are nowadays employed in several applications. Modeling
  urban street networks is one of them, and in particular to analyze criminal aspects
  of a city. Several research groups have focused on such application, but until now,
  there is a lack of a well-defined methodology for employing complex networks in
  a whole crime analysis process, i.e. from data preparation to a deep analysis of
  criminal communities. Furthermore, the ``toolset'' available for those works is
  not complete enough, also lacking techniques to maintain up-to-date, complete crime
  datasets and proper assessment measures. In this sense, we propose a threefold methodology
  for employing complex networks in the detection of highly criminal areas within
  a city. Our methodology comprises three tasks: (i) Mapping of Urban Crimes; (ii)
  Criminal Community Identification; and (iii) Crime Analysis. Moreover, it provides
  a proper set of assessment measures for analyzing intrinsic criminality of communities,
  especially when considering different crime types. We show our methodology by applying
  it to a real crime dataset from the city of San Francisco---CA, USA. The results
  confirm its effectiveness to identify and analyze high criminality areas within
  a city. Hence, our contributions provide a basis for further developments on complex
  networks applied to crime analysis."
