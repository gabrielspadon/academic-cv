abstract: Complex networks can be used for modeling street meshes and urban agglomerates.
  With such a model, many aspects of a city can be investigated to promote a better
  quality of life to its citizens. Along these lines, this paper proposes a set of
  distance-based pattern-discovery algorithmic instruments to improve urban structures
  modeled as complex networks, detecting nodes that lack access from/to points of
  interest in a given city. Furthermore, we introduce a greedy algorithm that is able
  to recommend improvements to the structure of a city by suggesting where points
  of interest are to be placed. We contribute to a thorough process to deal with complex
  networks, including mathematical modeling and algorithmic innovation. The set of
  our contributions introduces a systematic manner to treat a recurrent problem of
  broad interest in cities.
