abstract: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are very popular in the current
  eSport scenario, being highlighted in several competitions around the world. However,
  the domain of knowledge contained in these games is large, which makes it difficult
  to discover and predict the course of a match. The present work proposes the application
  of classification algorithms to determine the team with more chances to win a match.
  Two classifications procedures were used, one based on the composition of heroes
  in each team and another considering the duration of the match. The experiments
  were performed on data collected from 123,326 matches of Dota 2, showing that it
  was possible to achieve approximately 77% accuracy. The results demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the application when using techniques assisted by computers, and
  when using the methodology described in championships or other similar games that
  require the definition of strategies.
