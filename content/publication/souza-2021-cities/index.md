abstract: 'Graphs have often been used to answer questions about the interaction between
  real-world entities by taking advantage of their capacity to represent complex topologies.
  Complex networks are known to be graphs that capture such non-trivial topologies;
  they are able to represent human phenomena such as epidemic processes, the dynamics
  of populations, and the urbanization of cities. The investigation of complex networks
  has been extrapolated to many fields of science, with particular emphasis on computing
  techniques, including artificial intelligence. In such a case, the analysis of the
  interaction between entities of interest is transposed to the internal learning
  of algorithms, a paradigm whose investigation is able to expand the state of the
  art in Computer Science. By exploring this paradigm, this thesis puts together complex
  networks and machine learning techniques to improve the understanding of the human
  phenomena observed in pandemics, pendular migration, and street networks. Accordingly,
  we contribute with: (i) a new neural network architecture capable of modeling dynamic
  processes observed in spatial and temporal data with applications in epidemics propagation,
  weather forecasting, and patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning
  methodology for analyzing and predicting links in the scope of human mobility between
  all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques for identifying inconsistencies
  in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most influential vertices, with
  applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We obtained results sustained
  by sound evidence of advances to the state of the art in artificial intelligence,
  rigorous formalisms, and ample experimentation. Our findings rely upon real-world
  applications in a range of domains, demonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.'
