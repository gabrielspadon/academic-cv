abstract: One of many challenges in a web information systems is the capability of
  staying stable and available as the number of users and requests increase rapidly,
  what we call scalability. This paper provides a model based on development of events-oriented
  applications, non-blocking in the environment Node.JS with the non-relational database
  model (MongoDB), preparing to establish scalability and a comparison with a traditional
  model (relational database (MySQL), HTTP Apache server and PHP language). The results
  obtained reveal that the proposed model is more efficient (response time of six
  to eight faster) than the comparative model, can be used in production environments
  with development quality, performance improvement and scalability.
