abstract: Pantanal is one of the most important biomes of the world, with a large
  number of wild animal species, some of them are in extinction. The automatic identification
  of wild animals is extremely important for the estimation of the species' population
  within Pantanal. However, digital processing techniques for the identification and
  tracking of species have faced great challenges due to clumsy light and pose conditions
  present in images taken in the wild. To overcome such problems, we propose a methodology
  that, by combining regular RGB images and thermal images, improves the identilication
  of species even in images taken in rough circumstances. We use the SLIC segmentation
  algorithm to identify the regions of the images where animals are present; after
  that, we apply convolutional neural networks to classify the identified regions
  according to eight possible animal species. We experiment on a real-world dataset
  composed of 1,600 images. Our results showed an average gain between 6% and 10%
  when compared to the method Fast R-CNN.
