abstract: This Research Full Paper introduces a machine learning methodology to automatically
  identify the learning style of students interacting with a Learning Management System.
  Studies in Cognitive Psychology and Pedagogy have already reported that each individual
  has a specific Learning Style, which describes her/his best means of perceiving
  and acquiring knowledge. The detection of the personal Learning Style of each student
  has long been made by using questionnaires; an analysis that demands too much effort,
  mainly in courses with hundreds of students. Therefore, the automatic modeling of
  learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This
  study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students'
  Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle
  learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects
  during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of
  Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single
  machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy
  comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different
  algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior
  to those reported in the related literature.
