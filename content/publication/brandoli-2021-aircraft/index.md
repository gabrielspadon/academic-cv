abstract: Corrosion identification and repair is a vital task in aircraft maintenance
  to ensure continued structural integrity. Regarding fuselage lap joints, typically,
  visual inspections are followed by non-destructive methodologies, which are time-consuming.
  The visual inspection of large areas suffers not only from subjectivity but also
  from the variable probability of corrosion detection, which is aggravated by the
  multiple layers used in fuselage construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology
  for automatic image-based corrosion detection of aircraft structures using deep
  neural networks. For machine learning, we use a dataset that consists of D-Sight
  Aircraft Inspection System (DAIS) images from different lap joints of Boeing and
  Airbus aircrafts. We also employ transfer learning to overcome the shortage of aircraft
  corrosion images. With precision of over 93%, we demonstrate that our approach detects
  corrosion with a precision comparable to that of trained operators, aiding to reduce
  the uncertainties related to operator fatigue or inadequate training. Our results
  indicate that our methodology can support specialists and engineers in corrosion
  monitoring in the aerospace industry, potentially contributing to the automation
  of condition-based maintenance protocols.
