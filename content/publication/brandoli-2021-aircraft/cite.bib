 abstract = {Corrosion identification and repair is a vital task in aircraft maintenance to ensure continued structural integrity. Regarding fuselage lap joints, typically, visual inspections are followed by non-destructive methodologies, which are time-consuming. The visual inspection of large areas suffers not only from subjectivity but also from the variable probability of corrosion detection, which is aggravated by the multiple layers used in fuselage construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatic image-based corrosion detection of aircraft structures using deep neural networks. For machine learning, we use a dataset that consists of D-Sight Aircraft Inspection System (DAIS) images from different lap joints of Boeing and Airbus aircrafts. We also employ transfer learning to overcome the shortage of aircraft corrosion images. With precision of over 93%, we demonstrate that our approach detects corrosion with a precision comparable to that of trained operators, aiding to reduce the uncertainties related to operator fatigue or inadequate training. Our results indicate that our methodology can support specialists and engineers in corrosion monitoring in the aerospace industry, potentially contributing to the automation of condition-based maintenance protocols.},
