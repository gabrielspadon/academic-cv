abstract: We propose an algebraic tool-set and related algorithms to track access
  problems not obviously observed in urban environments represented as street mashes.
  Our tool-set assumes that points of interest must be promptly accessible within
  the paths of a street network. Over that assumption, we introduce formalisms and
  computational tools to detect and evaluate access-related problems. The output of
  our methods, in the form of inconsistent nodes found in a given city, has the potential
  to assist the decision-making process regarding the positioning of resources, building
  of new services, and outlining the initial design of a city.
