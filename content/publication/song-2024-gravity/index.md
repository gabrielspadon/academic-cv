abstract: Invasive species in water bodies pose a major threat to the environment
  and biodiversity globally. Due to increased transportation and trade, non-native
  species have been introduced to new environments, causing damage to ecosystems and
  leading to economic losses in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Therefore, there
  is a pressing need for risk assessment and management techniques to mitigate the
  impact of these invasions. This study aims to develop a new physics-inspired model
  to forecast maritime shipping traffic and thus inform risk assessment of invasive
  species spread through global transportation networks. Inspired by the gravity model
  for international trades, our model considers various factors that influence the
  likelihood and impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance
  between ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs. Additionally,
  by analyzing the risk network of invasive species, we provide a comprehensive framework
  for assessing the invasion threat level given a pair of origin and destination.
  Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to gravity models to rebuild the
  short- and long-term dependencies that make the risk analysis feasible. Thus, we
  introduce a physics-inspired framework that achieves an 89% segmentation accuracy
  for existing and non-existing trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number
  of vessels flowing between key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement
  over the traditional deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes
  to a better understanding of invasive species risk assessment. It allows policymakers,
  conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by identifying
  high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and can include new
  data sources, making it suitable for assessing species invasion risks in a changing
  global landscape.
