abstract: For a long time, data has been treated as a general problem because it just
  represents fractions of an event without any relevant purpose. However, the last
  decade has been just about information and how to get it. Seeking meaning in data
  and trying to solve scalability problems, many frameworks have been developed to
  improve data storage and its analysis. As a framework, Hadoop was presented as a
  powerful tool to deal with large amounts of data. However, it still causes doubts
  about how to deal with its deployment and if there is any reliable method to compare
  the performance of distinct Hadoop clusters. This paper presents a methodology based
  on benchmark analysis to guide the Hadoop cluster deployment. The experiments employed
  The Apache Hadoop and the Hadoop distributions of Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR,
  analyzing the architectures on local and on clouding—using centralized and geographically
  distributed servers. The results show the methodology can be dynamically applied
  on a reliable comparison among different architectures. Additionally, the study
  suggests that the knowledge acquired can be used to improve the data analysis process
  by understanding the Hadoop architecture.
