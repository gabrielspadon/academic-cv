abstract: This paper presents a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach
  to predict the next 12 h of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 h of Automatic Identification
  System data as input. The strategy involves fusing spatiotemporal features from
  AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data to
  reduce forecasting uncertainty. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately
  85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under
  such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures
  and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the
  well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out
  among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making
  during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves
  more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively,
  a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model
  from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard
  whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative
  and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.
