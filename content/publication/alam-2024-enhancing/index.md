abstract: Predicting vessel trajectories is crucial for enhancing situational awareness
  and preventing collisions at sea. However, achieving accurate and efficient predictions
  is challenging due to the heterogeneity in vessel movement patterns and changes
  in vessel mobility modes during voyages. To address this, we propose a new approach
  that uses historical AIS data to cluster route patterns for each vessel type, thereby
  improving prediction accuracy. By training machine learning algorithms to focus
  only on similar vessel types, this approach can better predict individual vessel
  mobility patterns. This approach offers computational advantages by using a relatively
  small set of trajectories from the nearest cluster of a selected vessel. Both spatial
  and course attributes are considered to determine the nearest cluster, while engineered
  features capture changes in vessel mobility modes. Using an AIS dataset from UTM
  Zone 10N (US West Coast), we achieved distance errors of 370m, 742m, and 1.2km for
  horizons 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively, using the Random Forest algorithm for
  short-term trajectory prediction (<= 30 min) with the last 1-hour trajectory of
  selected vessels as input.
