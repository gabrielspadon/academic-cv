abstract: Sleep disorders pose serious cardiovascular threats if not treated effectively.
  However, adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), the most recommended
  therapy, is known to be challenging to monitor. Telemonitored CPAP equipment has
  improved the follow-up of CPAP adherence (hours of use per night) by producing far
  larger amounts of data collected daily. The analysis of such data have relied on
  averaging the entire therapeutic history and interpreting it without a proper reference
  concerning the level of adherence. By contrast, we contribute with an unsupervised
  machine-learning methodology that (i) translates the adherence data to a scale of
  discrete numbers that hold correspondence to the most usual 30-day-long patterns
  as observed in a real-word database; (ii) avoids the loss of information aggregation
  problem by creating summaries of the time series that capture the dynamic nature
  of the everyday-use CPAP. Our experiments have detected eight particular adherence
  behaviors validated with information-oriented statistical criteria; we successfully
  applied them to the time series of a French hospital to produce summaries that reflect
  the adherence of any 30 days of interest. Our method can aid physicians in more
  precisely evaluating the therapy adherence, as well as fostering systems to alert
  of problems in the treatment automatically.
