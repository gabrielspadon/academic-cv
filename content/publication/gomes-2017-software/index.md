abstract: "Software Quality Assurance is a sub-process that ensures that developed
  software meets and complies with defined or standardized quality specifications.
  Focusing on source code, there are characteristics that can be used to evaluate
  the quality. Introductory courses must encourage freshmen students to improve internal
  quality of their source code, but only as sophomore they have contact with Software
  Engineering concepts, including Quality Assurance. In this paper we present a tool
  to source code quality evaluation aimed at supporting students to improve their
  source code and, consequently, their programming skills. The proposed tool uses
  quality reports (available to professional environment integrate with software repositories)
  to analyze students' source code and provide a feedback about the student coding.
  The proposed tool run locally, with few computational resources. In addition, we
  proposed the methodology to use the proposed tool: it consists of challenging students
  to perform a set of maintenance tasks in a controlled environment. We prepared a
  source code by introducing common defects, what decreases the quality of source
  code, and ask to students to perform maintenance tasks in order to both eliminate
  the introduced defects and introduce new features. After each modification, the
  students must evaluate their code using the proposed tool to obtain a feedback about
  quality of source code. To evaluate the approach and the tool, we created a survey
  and applied to students and the teacher. As a result, we show the benefits of using
  the proposed tool to both teachers and students perspectives. The results are positive
  to enhance the teaching-learning Software Quality Assurance to Software Engineering
  students."
