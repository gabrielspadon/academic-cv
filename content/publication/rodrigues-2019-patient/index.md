abstract: Automated medical prognosis has gained interest as artificial intelligence
  evolves and the potential for computer-aided medicine becomes evident. Nevertheless,
  it is challenging to design an effective system that, given a patient's medical
  history, is able to predict probable future conditions. Previous works, mostly carried
  out over private datasets, have tackled the problem by using artificial neural network
  architectures that cannot deal with low-cardinality datasets, or by means of non-generalizable
  inference approaches. We introduce a Deep Learning architecture whose design results
  from an intensive experimental process. The final architecture is based on two parallel
  Minimal Gated Recurrent Unit networks working in bi-directional manner, which was
  extensively tested with the open-access Mimic-III dataset. Our results demonstrate
  significant improvements in automated medical prognosis, as measured with Recall@k.
  We summarize our experience as a set of relevant insights for the design of Deep
  Learning architectures. Our work improves the performance of computer-aided medicine
  and can serve as a guide in designing artificial neural networks used in prediction
  tasks.
