abstract: Street networks are complex networks that represent the topology and geometry
  of cities; as so, they can be used to solve problems related to ill-designed urban
  structures. This application, in real urban scenarios, has been the focus of several
  types of research, from cities characterization to transportation enhancement. Nevertheless,
  these works lack a clear and in-depth methodology to characterize the urban space
  by means of complex networks. Aided by topo-geometrical measures from street networks,
  we present a methodology to identify what we call urban inconsistencies, which are
  characterized by low-access regions containing nodes (crossing streets) that lack
  efficient access from or to other regions in a city. We devised algorithms capable
  of preprocessing and analyzing street networks, pointing to existing mobility problems
  in a city. We identify inconsistencies that pertain to a given node where a facility
  of interest is currently placed; the results introduce ways to assist in the urban
  planning and design processes. Our techniques are discussed through the analysis
  of a real-world city. In a real context, the methods provide basis for analyzing
  and improving the placement of facilities.
