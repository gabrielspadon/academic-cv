 abstract = {Street networks are complex networks that represent the topology and geometry of cities; as so, they can be used to solve problems related to ill-designed urban structures. This application, in real urban scenarios, has been the focus of several types of research, from cities characterization to transportation enhancement. Nevertheless, these works lack a clear and in-depth methodology to characterize the urban space by means of complex networks. Aided by topo-geometrical measures from street networks, we present a methodology to identify what we call urban inconsistencies, which are characterized by low-access regions containing nodes (crossing streets) that lack efficient access from or to other regions in a city. We devised algorithms capable of preprocessing and analyzing street networks, pointing to existing mobility problems in a city. We identify inconsistencies that pertain to a given node where a facility of interest is currently placed; the results introduce ways to assist in the urban planning and design processes. Our techniques are discussed through the analysis of a real-world city. In a real context, the methods provide basis for analyzing and improving the placement of facilities.},
