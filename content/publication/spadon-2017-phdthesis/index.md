abstract: Cities are complex systems of transportation and social activity; their
  structure can be used to model urban street networks i.e. complex network that represents
  the geometry of a city allowing analytical activities for data-driven decision-making.
  The geometry of a city holds intrinsic information that can support activities related
  to the analysis of the urban scenario; of higher importance is the use of such information
  to enhance the quality of life of its inhabitants and/or to understand the dynamics
  of an urban center. Several of these analytical processes lacks in-depth methodologies
  to analyze crime patterns and ill-designed urban structures, which can provide for
  public safety and urban design. Consequently, it is our goal to provide means for
  the structural and topological analysis of highly criminal regions of cities represented
  as complex networks, and for the identification of urban planning inconsistencies
  that point to regions that lack access from/to points of interest in a city. In
  this regard, we devised a set of algebraic and algorithmic procedures that are capable
  of revealing patterns and provide for data comprehension. More specifically, we
  introduced pre-processing techniques to transform georeferenced electronic maps
  into graph representations of cities; we used metric-based and epidemic processes
  to understand the dynamics of cities in what refers to criminality; finally, we
  introduced a novel set of formalisms and operations based on set theory to identify
  design flaws concerning access in urban centers. Our results refer to approaches
  to preprocess and prepare maps in the form of urban street networks; to the analyses
  of crimes based on their spatial disposition; to the development of a model to describe
  criminal activities; and, to the advance of a concept based on critical problems
  in the urban design.
