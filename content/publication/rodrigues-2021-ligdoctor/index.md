abstract: The interest for patient trajectory prediction, a sort of computer-aided
  medicine, has steadily increased with the pace of artificial intelligence innovation.
  Notwithstanding, the design of effective systems able to predict clinical outcomes
  based on the history of a patient is far from trivial. Works so far are based on
  neural architectures with low performance, especially when using low-cardinality
  datasets; alternatively, complex inference approaches are hard to reproduce and/or
  extrapolate as they are designed for very specific circumstances. We introduce LIG-Doctor,
  an artificial neural network architecture based on two Minimal Gated Recurrent Unit
  networks functioning in a bidirectional parallel manner, benefiting from temporal
  events both forward and backward. In comparison to state-of-the-art works, consistent
  improvements were achieved in prognosis prediction, as assessed with metrics Recall@k,
  Precision@k, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Besides the detailed delineation of our architecture,
  a sequence of experiments is reported with insights that progressively guided design
  decisions to inspire future works on similar problems. Our results shall contribute
  to the improvement of computer-aided medicine and, more generally, to processes
  related to the design of neural network architectures.
