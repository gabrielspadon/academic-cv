abstract: "The need for higher agricultural productivity has demanded the intensive
  use of pesticides. However, their correct use depends on assessment methods that
  can accurately predict how well the pesticides' spraying covered the intended crop
  region. Some methods have been proposed in the literature, but their high cost and
  low portability harm their widespread use. This paper proposes and experimentally
  evaluates a new methodology based on the use of a smartphone-based mobile application,
  named DropLeaf. Experiments performed using DropLeaf showed that, in addition to
  its versatility, it can predict with high accuracy the pesticide spraying. DropLeaf
  is a five-fold image-processing methodology based on: (i) color space conversion;
  (ii) threshold noise removal; (iii) convolutional operations of dilation and erosion;
  (iv) detection of contour markers in the water-sensitive card; and, (v) identification
  of droplets via the marker-controlled watershed transformation. The authors performed
  successful experiments over two case studies, the first using a set of synthetic
  cards and the second using a real-world crop. The proposed tool can be broadly used
  by farmers equipped with conventional mobile phones, improving the use of pesticides
  with health, environmental and financial benefits."
