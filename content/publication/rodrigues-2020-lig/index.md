abstract: Automated medical prognosis has gained interest as artificial intelligence
  evolves and the potential for computer-aided medicine becomes evident. Nevertheless,
  it is challenging to design an effective system that, given a patient's medical
  history, can predict probable future conditions. Previous works have tackled the
  problem by using artificial neural network architectures that do not benefit from
  bi-directional temporal processing, or by utilizing non-generalizable inference
  approaches. Differently, we introduce a Deep Learning architecture whose design
  results from an intensive experimental process; our final architecture is based
  on two parallel Minimal Gated Recurrent Unit networks working in bi-directional
  manner, which was extensively tested with two real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate
  significant improvements in automated medical prognosis, as measured with metrics
  Precision@, Recall@, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC. We contribute with an architecture and
  with insights for the design of Deep Learning architectures.
