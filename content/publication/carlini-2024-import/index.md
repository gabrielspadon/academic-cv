abstract: Seaports play a crucial role in the global economy, and researchers have
  sought to understand their significance through various studies. In this paper,
  we aim to explore the common characteristics shared by important ports by analyzing
  the network of connections formed by vessel movement among them. To accomplish this
  task, we adopt a bottom-up network construction approach that combines three years'
  worth of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from around the world, constructing
  a Ports Network that represents the connections between different ports. Through
  such representation, we use machine learning to measure the relative significance
  of different port features. Our model examined such features and revealed that geographical
  characteristics and the depth of the port are indicators of a port's significance
  to the Ports Network. Accordingly, this study employs a data-driven approach and
  utilizes machine learning to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors
  contributing to ports' importance. The outcomes of our work are aimed to inform
  decision-making processes related to port development, resource allocation, and
  infrastructure planning in the industry.
