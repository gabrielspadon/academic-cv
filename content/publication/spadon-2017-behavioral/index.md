abstract: Complex networks are commonly used to model urban street networks, which
  allows aiding the analysis of criminal activities in cities. Despite several works
  focusing on such application, there is a lack of a clear methodology focused in
  the analysis of crime behavior. In this sense, we propose a methodology for employing
  complex networks in the analysis of criminality spread within criminal areas of
  a city. Here, we evaluate synthetic cases of crime propagation concerning real criminal
  data from the North American city of San Francisco â€” CA. Our results confirm the
  effectiveness of our methodology in analyzing the crime behavior by means of criminality
  spread. Hence, this paper renders further development and planning on public safety
  in cities.
