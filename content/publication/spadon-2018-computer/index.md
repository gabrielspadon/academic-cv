abstract: The basic purpose of a map is to trace shortest paths between two locations
  in a city. However, this is not always what a user needs. Consider a tourist in
  an unknown city, he/she might want to trace routes to visit multiple landmarks while
  passing through the main streets of the city, possibly more than once through the
  same street. Such functionality is not yet available in online map services, which
  are prone to provide shortest paths that connect all landmarks. Rather, is of common
  interest a tour that puts together the most central streets (topologically speaking),
  minimizes the trajectory and, at the same time, passes through such landmarks. To
  cope with this problem, it is possible to investigate techniques of Center-Piece
  Subgraph, Absorbing Random Walk Centrality and Spanning Edge-Betweenness; such techniques
  can be used to find induced subgraphs that optimize centrality measures for a set
  of referential nodes or edges, i.e. landmarks or streets. The results shall be in
  the form of optimized algorithms, and how to integrate them into online systems.
  Studies in this line can succeed if they can guarantee timely scalability at the
  same time that they provide algorithms that produce tours (1) considering all the
  known destinations; (2) including the main streets of a city; and, (3) ensuring
  the shortest routes.
