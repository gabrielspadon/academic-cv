abstract: Building a velocity model is essential in seismic exploration and is used
  at all stages, including acquisition, processing and interpretation of seismic data.
  Reconstructing a subsurface image from seismic wavefields recorded at the surface
  (seismograms) requires accurate knowledge of the propagation velocities between
  the recording location and the image location at depth. Estimation of velocity models
  can also be used as initial models to recursively generate high-resolution velocity
  models through optimization algorithms. Machine learning is a field of artificial
  intelligence that uses computational techniques to give systems the ability to learn
  from a large volume of data. In particular, neural networks have been developed
  to reconstruct subsurface parameters, i.e., the acoustic (compressional) wave velocity
  model, directly from raw seismic data. Using this principle as a starting point
  we will use two neural network approaches to solve the problem, where a GAN neural
  network and a ReGENN network will be used.
