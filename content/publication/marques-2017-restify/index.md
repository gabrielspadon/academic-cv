abstract: The volume of data exchanged by computer networks is gradually increasing
  over time, which provides the need for performance and interoperability between
  different platforms and systems. In this line, there are several studies dedicated
  to service-oriented software architectures and resource consumption models. However,
  a few of them are focused on the development of generic tools for the dynamic creation
  of data provisioning services. This article presents the analysis of a tool called
  Restify, which is able to dynamically create web services to provide an online database
  as a service. Restify achieved the system interoperability requirements regarding
  heterogeneous operations, programming languages, and server infrastructures. As
  a result, we observed that the performance of this tool was comparable, if not better,
  than other evaluated web services, such as REST and SOAP. Finally, Restify excels
  by behaving like an interface tool, allowing the management and integration of multiple
  online system tools with various relational databases.
