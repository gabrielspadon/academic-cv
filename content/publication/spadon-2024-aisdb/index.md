abstract: Efficiently handling Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is vital
  for enhancing maritime safety and navigation, yet is hindered by the system's high
  volume and error-prone datasets. This paper introduces the Automatic Identification
  System Database (AISdb), a novel tool designed to address the challenges of processing
  and analyzing AIS data. AISdb is a comprehensive, open-source platform that enables
  the integration of AIS data with environmental datasets, thus enriching analyses
  of vessel movements and their environmental impacts. By facilitating AIS data collection,
  cleaning, and spatio-temporal querying, AISdb significantly advances AIS data research.
  Utilizing AIS data from various sources, AISdb demonstrates improved handling and
  analysis of vessel information, contributing to enhancing maritime safety, security,
  and environmental sustainability efforts.
