 abstract = {Efficiently handling Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is vital for enhancing maritime safety and navigation, yet is hindered by the system's high volume and error-prone datasets. This paper introduces the Automatic Identification System Database (AISdb), a novel tool designed to address the challenges of processing and analyzing AIS data. AISdb is a comprehensive, open-source platform that enables the integration of AIS data with environmental datasets, thus enriching analyses of vessel movements and their environmental impacts. By facilitating AIS data collection, cleaning, and spatio-temporal querying, AISdb significantly advances AIS data research. Utilizing AIS data from various sources, AISdb demonstrates improved handling and analysis of vessel information, contributing to enhancing maritime safety, security, and environmental sustainability efforts.},
