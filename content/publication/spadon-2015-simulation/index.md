abstract: The data growth enhances the need of a method and paradigms responsible
  to deal with high scalability, reliability and fault tolerance in large amounts
  of data. Big Data is a framework capable of dealing with this need. This research
  makes usage of Apache Hadoop, and a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to analyze the
  performance through benchmark tests executed on locally, geographically distributed,
  and centralized Hadoop computational layout. The result from the simulations metrics,
  and performance analyses are compared to real servers and introduce an alternative
  model implemented with a tunnel protocol that enhance the processing power of the
  cluster.
