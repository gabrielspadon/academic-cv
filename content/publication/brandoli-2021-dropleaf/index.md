abstract: Pesticides have been heavily used in the cultivation of major crops, contributing
  to the increase of crop production over the past decades. However, in many cases
  their appropriate use and calibration of machines rely upon dated evaluation methodologies
  that cannot precisely estimate how well the pesticidesâ€™ are being applied to the
  crop. A few strategies have been proposed in former works, yet their elevated costs
  and low portability do not permit their wide spread adoption. This work introduces
  and experimentally assesses a novel tool that functions as a smartphone-based mobile
  application, named DropLeaf - Spraying Meter. Tests performed using DropLeaf demonstrated
  that, notwithstanding its simplicity, it can estimate the pesticide coverage with
  high precision. Our methodology is based on the development of custom image analysis
  software for real-time assessment of spraying deposition of water-sensitive papers.
  The proposed tool can be extensively used by farmers and agronomists carrying regular
  smartphones, improving the utilization of pesticides with well-being, ecological,
  and monetary advantages. DropLeaf can be easily used for spray drift assessment
  of different methods, including emerging unmanned aerial vehicle and smart sprayers.
