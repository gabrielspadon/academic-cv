abstract: Databases and Distributed Systems have a fundamental relevance in Computer
  Science; they are usually presented in courses where the high-level of abstraction
  characterizes the teaching and learning processes. Consequently, the teaching method
  needs to evolve to fulfill the present requirements. Therefore, grounded in these
  concepts, the main goal of this paper is to introduce a teaching methodology via
  benchmark tests. Our methodology was conducted using the Hadoop framework, and it
  is innovative and proved effective. Our methods allow students to be exposed to
  complex data, system architecture, network infrastructure, trending technologies
  and algorithms. During the courses, students analyzed the performance of some computational
  architectures through benchmark tests on local and on the cloud. Along with this
  scenario, they evaluate the processing time of each architecture. As a result, our
  methodology proved to be a support learning method, which allows students to have
  contact with trending tools.
