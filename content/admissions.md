This content is intended to guide you in the adimission processes at the Faculty of Computer Science of Dalhousie University.
This content is originally from Prof. Paul Ralph, which I adapted

You do not need a Master’s degree to begin a PhD at Dalhousie. Apply for a PhD if:

- You love learning.
- You are interested in a career in research or academia.
- Professors who know you well think you’re ready for a PhD.
- You want to contribute to humanity’s cumulative body of knowledge.
- You enjoy writing (there’s a lot of writing in grad school).
- You have a high level of perseverance and self-efficacy.
- You want to coach others and help them succeed.

Avoid pursuing a PhD for these reasons:

- You’re about to graduate and don’t know what else to do.
- A PhD sounds easier than getting a job (it’s not).
- You want to move to another country and think a PhD will facilitate that.
- You feel entitled to a PhD.
- Someone (e.g., a parent) is pressuring you to earn a PhD.

To join my lab as a PhD student, you need:

- A first-class degree (Master’s or bachelor’s)—whatever “first class” means at your university—in computer science, software engineering, computer systems engineering, information systems, or a similar discipline.
- A cumulative GPA equivalent of at least 3.7 out of 4.3 (about 3.4/4, 8.5/10, or 17/20) in your most recent degree.
- Evidence of research aptitude, such as one or more peer-reviewed publications (or posters or presentations) in reputable conferences, journals, or workshops.
- One or more indicators of English proficiency:
  - A degree taught completely in English,
  - IELTS score of 7 or higher in all categories,
  - TOEFL score of 95 or higher,
  - A similar score in MELAB, CanTest, CAEL, or PTE academic,
  - Evidence that English is your first language.

*If you scored lower than 7 on the IELTS test or equivalent, you may be admitted to the PhD program contingent on passing an EAP Placement Course. The courses you will need to complete depend on your English test scores.

**Applying for a PhD**

I only accept PhD students who receive an external scholarship such as the Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship or Canadian Graduate Scholarship. You must apply for admission and apply for scholarships separately. Dalhousie does not accept self-funded PhD students unless you are independently wealthy and decline funding on moral grounds.

If you already have funding and are looking for a supervisor, email me. Otherwise, do not email me yet. Keep reading.

Canadian citizens and permanent residents should apply for the Canadian Graduate Scholarship (typically due at the beginning of October). All applicants should apply for a Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship through the harmonized scholarship process (typically due mid-January). Our guide for PhD applicants explains how to apply for these awards.

Once you have applied through the harmonized scholarship process, proceed to apply for the program. Remember to select me as your preferred supervisor and explain which project(s) you’re interested in. If you need help with the application, email graduate@cs.dal.ca. Once your complete application has been received, I will be in touch.

**Applying for a Master’s**

**Self-funded Master’s**: Most MSc students are self-funded. If you plan to self-fund, apply here as soon as possible. The official deadlines are June 1 for Canadians or April 1 for international students. You don’t need to contact prospective supervisors first. Your application should speak for itself. There is always space in my lab for enthusiastic and diligent self-funded MSc students. You will receive the same mentoring and opportunities as scholarship-funded students. I will try to help you find RA and TA work, but it’s not guaranteed.

**Scholarship-funded Master’s**: Do not email me to ask for a scholarship. That’s not how it works. You apply for scholarships through the harmonized scholarship process (typically due mid-January). Canadian citizens and permanent residents should also apply for the Canadian Graduate Scholarship (typically due at the beginning of December). Most successful applicants have a GPA of at least 3.7/4.3. You can email me your proposal for feedback. Don’t leave it to the last minute.
