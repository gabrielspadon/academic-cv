      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University, Halifax - NS, Canada. I hold a Ph.D. and an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos - SP, Brazil. My research focuses on spatio-temporal analytics, time-series forecasting, and complex network mining, with a deep involvement in Ocen Data Science and Engineering, GeoInformatics, and a particular interest in ocean mobility and trajectory-related problems.
