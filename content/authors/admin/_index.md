## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University, Halifax - NS, Canada. I hold a Ph.D. and an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos - SP, Brazil. My research focuses on spatio-temporal analytics, time-series forecasting, and complex network mining, with a deep involvement in Data Science & Engineering and GeoInformatics, and a particular interest in mobility and trajectory-related problems.
