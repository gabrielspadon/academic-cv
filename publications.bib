  abstract     = {Software Quality Assurance is a sub-process that ensures that developed software meets and complies with defined or standardized quality specifications. Focusing on source code, there are characteristics that can be used to evaluate the quality. Introductory courses must encourage freshmen students to improve internal quality of their source code, but only as sophomore they have contact with Software Engineering concepts, including Quality Assurance. In this paper we present a tool to source code quality evaluation aimed at supporting students to improve their source code and, consequently, their programming skills. The proposed tool uses quality reports (available to professional environment integrate with software repositories) to analyze students' source code and provide a feedback about the student coding. The proposed tool run locally, with few computational resources. In addition, we proposed the methodology to use the proposed tool: it consists of challenging students to perform a set of maintenance tasks in a controlled environment. We prepared a source code by introducing common defects, what decreases the quality of source code, and ask to students to perform maintenance tasks in order to both eliminate the introduced defects and introduce new features. After each modification, the students must evaluate their code using the proposed tool to obtain a feedback about quality of source code. To evaluate the approach and the tool, we created a survey and applied to students and the teacher. As a result, we show the benefits of using the proposed tool to both teachers and students perspectives. The results are positive to enhance the teaching-learning Software Quality Assurance to Software Engineering students.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical Computer Science area (TCS) stands out by being an important study field, and it is composed by Formal Languages and Automata Theory (FLA), Computer Science Theory (CST), and Theory of Compilers (TC). This area is responsible for introducing the beginnings of the Computer Science through formalisms - which represent a set of methods, techniques, or rules that describe the solution to a problem with restrictions - and it has a substantial impact on the student's knowledge. Computer science theory is based on the understanding of computability and techniques to solve challenges, and to improve the teaching-learning process used to introduce these concepts we proposed a Combined Methodology for Theoretical Computing (CMTC). Our methodology is based on formalism development to ground the knowledge acquired during classes of FLA, CST, and TC, where students are introduced to Theoretical Computing during one year and a half. In each course, we applied the same methodology where each student used data structures, computer graphics, and algorithms to solve problems. We address this methodology to understand how much the incomprehension of formalisms is influenced by new concepts and its abstractions. Against this background, we demonstrate that the that CMTC has the aim to build knowledge and make the new concepts and formalisms concrete. Our results are based on statistical analysis from students' grades, where we could observe among other results, the correlation between the practical activities and the conceptual knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Medical exams, such as CT scans and mammograms, are obtained and stored every day in hospitals all over the world, including images, patient data, and medical reports. It is paramount to have tools and systems to improve computer-aided diagnoses based on such huge volumes of stored information. The Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a powerful paradigm to help reaching such a goal, providing physicians with intelligent retrieval tools to present him/her with similar or complementary cases, in which visual characteristics improve textual data. Employing comparative inspection on previous cases, the physician can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the case he/she is working on. Current hospital systems do not carry native CBIR functionalities yet, relying on add-on subsystems, which often do not adhere to the existing relational database infrastructures. In this work, we propose RAFIKI, a software prototype that extends the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) PostgreSQL, providing native support for CBIR functionalities, modular extensibility, and seamless integration for data science tools, such as Python and R. We show the applicability of our system by evaluating three clinical scenarios, performing queries over a real-world image dataset of lung exams. Our results spot actual potential in promoting informed decision-making from the physician's perspective. Besides, the system exhibited a higher performance when compared to previous systems found in the literature. Moreover, RAFIKI contributes with a model to establish how to put together CBIR concepts and relational data, providing a powerful design for further development of theoretical and practical concepts and tools.},

The automatic identification of wild animals is extremely important for the estimation of the species’ population within Pantanal. However, digital processing techniques for the identification and tracking of species have faced great challenges due to clumsy light and pose conditions present in images taken in the wild. To overcome such problems, we propose a methodology that, by combining regular RGB images and thermal images, improves the identilication of species even in images taken in rough circumstances. We use the SLIC segmentation algorithm to identify the regions of the images where animals are present; after that, we apply convolutional neural networks to classify the identified regions according to eight possible animal species. We experiment on a real-world dataset composed of 1,600 images. Our results showed an average gain between 6% and 10% when compared to the method Fast R-CNN.},

Consider a tourist in an unknown city, he/she might want to trace routes to visit multiple landmarks while passing through the main streets of the city, possibly more than once through the same street. Such functionality is not yet available in online map services, which are prone to provide shortest paths that connect all landmarks. Rather, is of common interest a tour that puts together the most central streets (topologically speaking), minimizes the trajectory and, at the same time, passes through such landmarks. To cope with this problem, it is possible to investigate techniques of Center-Piece Subgraph, Absorbing Random Walk Centrality and Spanning Edge-Betweenness; such techniques can be used to find induced subgraphs that optimize centrality measures for a set of referential nodes or edges, i.e. landmarks or streets. The results shall be in the form of optimized algorithms, and how to integrate them into online systems. Studies in this line can succeed if they can guarantee timely scalability at the same time that they provide algorithms that produce tours (1) considering all the known destinations; (2) including the main streets of a city; and, (3) ensuring the shortest routes.},

  abstract     = {Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are widely employed in several applications, including those that deal with data modeled as graphs. Existing solutions store every edge in a distinct row in the edge table, however, for most cases, such modeling does not provide adequate performance. In this work, we propose Edge-k, a technique to group the vertex neighborhood into a reduced number of rows in a table through additional columns that stores up to k edges per row. The technique provides a better table organization and reduces both table size and query processing time. We evaluate Edge-k table management for insert, update, delete and bulkload operations, and compare the query processing performance both with the conventional edge table — adopted by the existing frameworks — and with the Neo4j graph database. Experiments using Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) queries reveal that our new proposal approach always outperforms the conventional edge table as well as it was faster than Neo4j for the first iterations, being slightly slower than Neo4j only for iterations after having loaded the whole graph from disk to memory. It was able to reach a speedup of 66% over a representative real dataset, with an average reduction of up to 58% in our tests. The average speedup over synthetic datasets was up to 54%. Edge-k was also the best one when performing graph degree distribution queries. Moreover, the Edge-k table obtained a processing time reduction of 70% for bulkload operations, despite having an overhead of 50% for individual insert, update and delete operations. Finally, Edge-k advances the state of the art for graph data management within relational database systems.},

Studies in Cognitive Psychology and Pedagogy have already reported that each individual has a specific Learning Style, which describes her/his best means of perceiving and acquiring knowledge. The detection of the personal Learning Style of each student has long been made by using questionnaires; an analysis that demands too much effort, mainly in courses with hundreds of students. Therefore, the automatic modeling of learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students’ Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior to those reported in the related literature.},

However, existing works focus only on optimizing the recursive query statements and processing, disregarding the potential physical arrangements that might improve performance. In this work, we propose to use an approach based on adjacent-list storage to physically organize the graph-like data aiming at both reducing the recursive query time and the number of I/O operations. By using Clustered Tables, we tied the adjacency list in chunks for (i) storing both vertex and edge tables together in a Combined Tables approach; and (ii) reordering the edge table with the Edge Clustered Table approach using 20% and 80% of the total adjacency list size. The clustered approaches enabled a faster recursive query processing (up to 22%) and a reduction of up to 61% in the number of page accesses when compared to the Conventional approach. When starting from multiple vertices, the Combined Tables approach achieved a query reduction time of up to 50% in the first join operation, and Edge Clustered Table 20% provided an overall time reduction of up to 20%. The results show that our physical design is effective and allows one to use recursive queries without adaptations.},

However, when the need for graph-like queries arises, applications often execute a sequence of related queries in a single session. We argue that it is possible to reduce the total cost of a set of related queries, by expanding individual intermediate results and sharing them among multiple queries. SHARq is our framework that enables sharing intermediate results of the common graph-like queries Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP), Connected Components (CC), and PageRank (PR). Our solution prepares result tables expanded with additional columns to store partial results of graph-like query combinations, such as multiple SSSP, or a sequence of queries comprising SSSP, CC, and PR. Experimental results on 9 datasets show query speedups of up to ten times when combining multiple SSSP queries, and up to two times when combining SSSP, CC, and PR queries. The results reveal a significant reduction in the query time, providing timely results for analyses relying on multiple navigational graph-like queries.},

  abstract   = {Graphs have often been used to answer questions about the interaction between real-world entities by taking advantage of their capacity to represent complex topologies. Complex networks are known to be graphs that capture such non-trivial topologies; they are able to represent human phenomena such as epidemic processes, the dynamics of populations, and the urbanization of cities. The investigation of complex networks has been extrapolated to many fields of science, with particular emphasis on computing techniques, including artificial intelligence. In such a case, the analysis of the interaction between entities of interest is transposed to the internal learning of algorithms, a paradigm whose investigation is able to expand the state of the art in Computer Science. By exploring this paradigm, this thesis puts together complex networks and machine learning techniques to improve the understanding of the human phenomena observed in pandemics, pendular migration, and street networks. Accordingly, we contribute with: (i) a new neural network architecture capable of modeling dynamic processes observed in spatial and temporal data with applications in epidemics propagation, weather forecasting, and patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning methodology for analyzing and predicting links in the scope of human mobility between all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques for identifying inconsistencies in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most influential vertices, with applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We obtained results sustained by sound evidence of advances to the state of the art in artificial intelligence, rigorous formalisms, and ample experimentation. Our findings rely upon real-world applications in a range of domains, demonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.},

However, adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), the most recommended therapy, is known to be challenging to monitor. Telemonitored CPAP equipment has improved the follow-up of CPAP adherence (hours of use per night) by producing far larger amounts of data collected daily. The analysis of such data have relied on averaging the entire therapeutic history and interpreting it without a proper reference concerning the level of adherence. By contrast, we contribute with an unsupervised machine-learning methodology that (i) translates the adherence data to a scale of discrete numbers that hold correspondence to the most usual 30-day-long patterns as observed in a real-word database; (ii) avoids the loss of information aggregation problem by creating summaries of the time series that capture the dynamic nature of the everyday-use CPAP. Our experiments have detected eight particular adherence behaviors validated with information-oriented statistical criteria; we successfully applied them to the time series of a French hospital to produce summaries that reflect the adherence of any 30 days of interest. Our method can aid physicians in more precisely evaluating the therapy adherence, as well as fostering systems to alert of problems in the treatment automatically.},

  abstract   = {Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages are useful for tracking vessel activity across oceans worldwide using radio links and satellite transceivers. Such data play a significant role in tracking vessel activity and mapping mobility patterns such as those found during fishing activities. Accordingly, this paper proposes a geometric-driven semi-supervised approach for fishing activity detection from AIS data. Through the proposed methodology, it is shown how to explore the information included in the messages to extract features describing the geometry of the vessel route. To this end, we leverage the unsupervised nature of cluster analysis to label the trajectory geometry, highlighting changes in the vessel’s moving pattern, which tends to indicate fishing activity. The labels obtained by the proposed unsupervised approach are used to detect fishing activities, which we approach as a time-series classification task. We propose a solution using recurrent neural networks on AIS data streams with roughly 87% of the overall F-score on the whole trajectories of 50 different unseen fishing vessels. Such results are accompanied by a broad benchmark study assessing the performance of different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures. In conclusion, this work contributes by proposing a thorough process that includes data preparation, labeling, data modeling, and model validation. Therefore, we present a novel solution for mobility pattern detection that relies upon unfolding the geometry observed in the trajectory.},

  abstract   = {Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.},

  abstract  = {The growing prevalence of location-based devices has resulted in a significant abundance of location data from various tracking vendors. Nevertheless, a noticeable deficit exists regarding readily accessible, extensive, and publicly available datasets for research purposes, primarily due to privacy concerns and ownership constraints. There is a pressing need for expansive datasets to advance machine learning techniques in this domain. The absence of such resources currently represents a substantial hindrance to research progress in this field. Data augmentation is emerging as a popular technique to mitigate this issue in several domains. However, applying state-of-the-art techniques as-is proves challenging when dealing with trajectory data due to the intricate spatio-temporal dependencies inherent to such data. In this work, we propose a novel strategy for augmenting trajectory data that applies a geographical perturbation on trajectory points along a trajectory. Such a perturbation results in controlled changes in the raw trajectory and, consequently, causes changes in the trajectory feature space. We test our strategy in two trajectory datasets and show a performance improvement of approximately 20% when contrasted with the baseline. We believe this strategy will pave the way for a more comprehensive framework for trajectory data augmentation that can be used in fields where few labeled trajectory data are available for training machine learning models.},

  title      = {Gravity-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Ship Traffic Flow and Invasion Risk of Non-Indigenous Species via Ballast Water Discharge},
  year       = {2024},
  abstract   = {Invasive species in water bodies pose a major threat to the environment and biodiversity globally. Due to increased transportation and trade, non-native species have been introduced to new environments, causing damage to ecosystems and leading to economic losses in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Therefore, there is a pressing need for risk assessment and management techniques to mitigate the impact of these invasions. This study aims to develop a new physics-inspired model to forecast maritime shipping traffic and thus inform risk assessment of invasive species spread through global transportation networks. Inspired by the gravity model for international trades, our model considers various factors that influence the likelihood and impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance between ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs. Additionally, by analyzing the risk network of invasive species, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the invasion threat level given a pair of origin and destination. Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to gravity models to rebuild the short- and long-term dependencies that make the risk analysis feasible. Thus, we introduce a physics-inspired framework that achieves an 89% segmentation accuracy for existing and non-existing trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number of vessels flowing between key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement over the traditional deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes to a better understanding of invasive species risk assessment. It allows policymakers, conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by identifying high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and can include new data sources, making it suitable for assessing species invasion risks in a changing global landscape.},
